              I have always had a keen eye for spotting gaps, niches, and
              opportunities to develop challenges into novel, relevant, and
              meaningful products. My passion to create relevant products
              through software development enhances my ability to turn an idea
              into a tangible - value adding - product.

            <Paragraph caption>
              Skills can always be taught, but character is intrinsic. I'm
              naturally inquisitive, quite confident, and Iâ€™m continuously
              working on improving my abilities, one challenge at a time.

            <Paragraph body>
              I believe it is important to understand both design and
              development to achieve a successful product. By involving a
              front-end developer at the design and prototyping phase, technical
              challenges can be identified rapidly, producing a more consistent
              product in the most efficient manner.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph body>
              I am a strong supporter of producing prototypes before fully
              committing to coding. Each iteration of a prototype empowers the
              team to establish a continuous feedback loop from stakeholders
              about the product, at the soonest possible instance.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph body>
              I am also experienced in building business logic systems, to
              interact with servers via APIs, using technologies such as React,
              React Redux, and Redux-Sagas.
